          <p>I believe that the purpose of education is to help people become thoughtful, compassionate, and wise. For about 25 years I was a History and English teacher at both the high school and middle school levels. For the last 12 years of my classroom career, I was part of the faculty at Science Leadership Academy in Philadelphia where I was the founding History teacher. The school is known for its innovative project-based curriculum, early involvement in developing a 1-1 laptop program for students, and it's progressive approach in how technology can enhance learning environments. For three years I was also a part of a consortium of educators who worked in establishing two STEM schools in Cairo, Egypt based, in part, on the same vision of how to bring teaching and learning into the 21st century.</p>
